# WorldGen

This is a project for randomly generating maps.


## Usage
```
./gradlew run
```

Push g and go get a cup of coffee.  


I originally had this part of something else, 
but have only really worked on world generation.  If I don't get back to that then I 
should just immediately automatically generate the land and close.

When this finally finishes, you can view the generated maps in the export directory.
